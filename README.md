###State and justify the game that will be the basis for your interface
The game I will be making a VR user interface for is my comp230 group project, this game is primarily a rowing simulator with mini games and mysterious things happening. For the main mini game i am working on is where cats fall from the sky and come towards you and try and hurt you, your goal is to hit them away. 



###Assess VR/AR market
The Vr and AR market is ever expanding and progressing exceedingly. There is a lot of competition between which one is better, Virtual reality will be for the living room enclosed space where the player wants to explore fantasy worlds. Whereas the augmented reality will be for real life augmentin where the player can go anywhere with their phone. 



###Outline an initial design in detail
The initial design is somewhat subject to change as the game is made and new minigames require additional information on screen but for the initial base ui there are a few key components. The first is a real life stick or pole of some kind that the user holds in real life that swings the oar in game, with this i could have a device of some kind that when you wing and hit something it vibrates. Next is the health bar at the top of the screen and I would also put in a timer of sorts as each mini game will be have a time limit on it.
